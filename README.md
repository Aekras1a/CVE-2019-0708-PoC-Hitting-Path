# CVE-2019-0708-PoC-Hitting-Path
# Really Really Bad, don't judge this code hahaha (it's terrible)
It's only hitting vulnerable path in termdd.sys!!! NOT DOS
Tested only on Windows XP Sp3 x86, Windows 7 will need negotiation part probably so it won't work (I hope that work at all)
Maybe it will be useful for exploit development

## TO DO - I think that somebody will post PoC before I will do it xD
- Make code more flexible ( Calculating lengths of packets(ASN.1) is mostly hardcoded and its working almost for one case )
- Make negotiation part for Windows 7 https://code.acr.moe/kazari/rdp-replay/blob/6339ef8e88d0ee101b533fab9230ad3b73b5870c/libfree_rdp/libfreerdp-core/nego.h
- Make support for other keys, Now it's only supporting 128BIT RC4 NON-FIPS
- Code refactoring
